This was a trip which was planned and executed in a very short time, though it was in my mind from a very long time. A friend wanted to take his children to Himalaya, and what better way to introduce them to the mountains than in Ladakh! 

## Day 0
We flew to Mumbai in the evening and stayed over in a dingy hotel close to the airport. Some of us even set out in the night to see India Gate and Marine Drive. 

## Day 1
Started early from Mumbai and caught a flight to Leh at 7.35AM. The International Terminal in Mumbai is way better than the Domestic Terminal.
