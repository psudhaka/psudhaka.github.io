		Welcome to my homepage. I am currrently a Research Scientist in the AI for Image Analytics (AIIA) Lab at <b>GE Global Research</b>, Bangalore, India. Prior to this, I spent 
	nearly 3 years in the <b>ICTEAM institute, Universite catholique de Louvain</b>, Belgium, with Prof. Laurent Jacques during my postdoc. I obtained my PhD (2011) from 
	<b>INRIA Rennes - Bretagne Atlantique</b> (associated with Universite de Rennes 1), France, 
	under the supervision of Dr. Remi Gribonval. </p>

	<p>Before obtaining my M.Sc. (Engg.) degree (2007) from the Electrical Engineering department, IISc, Bangalore, I spent about 3 years in 
	industry developing signal processing algorithms.

	<h2>Research</h2>
  	<p>At the AIIA Lab in GE, I solve problems related to medical images using tools from classical image/signal processing
  	and machine learning. While I work on data driven methods, I believe domain knowledge can make a difference in problem solving. Also, 
  	my interests are in the development of techniques and algorithms concerning efficient acquisition and processing of 
  	high-dimensional signals/data and solving related inverse problems by exploiting their low-dimensional structures. </p>
